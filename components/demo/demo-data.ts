    question: 'Explain the concept of a derivative and its real-world applications.',
    aiResponse: 'Great explanation! A derivative measures the rate of change of a function at any given point. Let me break down your key points:\n\n1. Basic Concept:\n- The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at a point\n- It shows how quickly a quantity is changing\n\n2. Real-World Applications:\n- Physics: Calculate velocity (derivative of position) and acceleration (derivative of velocity)\n- Economics: Analyze marginal cost and revenue\n- Engineering: Optimize designs and processes\n\nSuggestion: Try to connect these concepts to everyday scenarios, like how the speedometer in a car shows the derivative of distance with respect to time!',
    aiHints: [
      'Think about how things change over time in the real world',
      'Consider the slope at different points on a curve',
      'Remember that velocity is a real-world example'

    question: 'Describe the process of cellular respiration and its importance.',
    aiResponse: 'Excellent work! Let me help you understand cellular respiration better:\n\n1. Process Overview:\n- Glucose + Oxygen â†’ Energy (ATP) + Water + CO2\n- Occurs in three main stages: Glycolysis, Citric Acid Cycle, and Electron Transport Chain\n\n2. Key Points:\n- Happens in mitochondria ("powerhouse" of the cell)\n- Produces 36-38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule\n- Essential for all living organisms\n\nTip: Think of it like a cellular power plant, converting food (glucose) into usable energy (ATP) for the cell!',

Character Development:\n- Macbeth: Initially honorable, corrupted by ambition\n- Lady Macbeth: Drives the ambition, later consumed by guilt\n\n2. Key Symbols:\n- The crown: Represents power and ambition\n- The dagger: Symbolizes the violent path to power\n\n3. Consequences:\n- Mental deterioration of both main characters\n- Destruction of natural order\n- Ultimate downfall\n\nConsider how Shakespeare shows ambition as both a motivating and destructive force!',
