  ```tsx
  {(question.options as string[]).map((text, idx) => {
    const option = String.fromCharCode(65 + idx); // Convert 0-3 to A-D
    const isCorrect = question.correctAnswerIndex === idx;
    // Render option
  })}
  ```

### Bug Fixes
#### Assignment Stats Calculation
- Removed dependency on non-existent `stats` field
- Added proper stats calculation from submissions:
  ```typescript
  // Calculate stats from submissions and answers
  const submissionCount = assignment.submissions.length;
  const totalStudents = assignment.class.students.length;
  
  const totalScore = assignment.submissions.reduce((acc, submission) => {
    const correctAnswers = submission.answers.filter(answer => 
      answer.selectedOption === assignment.questions.find(q => q.id === answer.questionId)?.correctAnswerIndex
    ).length;
    const score = (correctAnswers / assignment.questions.length) * 100;
    return acc + score;
  }, 0);
  ```

#### Data Fetching
- Updated Prisma query to include necessary relations:
  ```typescript
  include: {
    class: {
      include: {
        students: true
      }
    },
    questions: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        question: true,
        options: true,
        correctAnswerIndex: true,
        explanation: true,
      }
    },
    submissions: {
      include: {
        answers: true
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### Response Formatting
- Added explicit field selection for cleaner response:
  ```typescript
  return {
    id: assignment.id,
    title: assignment.title,
    subject: assignment.subject,
    dueDate: assignment.dueDate,
    class: {
      id: assignment.class.id,
      name: assignment.class.name,
    },
    questions: assignment.questions.map(q => ({
      id: q.id,
      question: q.question,
      options: typeof q.options === 'string' ? JSON.parse(q.options) : q.options,
      correctAnswerIndex: q.correctAnswerIndex,
      explanation: q.explanation,
    })),
    stats: {
      submissionCount,
      totalStudents,
      averageScore,
    }
  };
  ```

### Next Steps
